TO SOLVE ISSUE NO.5
    - I removed the filter and setFilter state from UserSearch component and created a new context state with it.
    because it's like a global state.
    -The filter context can be found in the context folder in src.
    -The part that closes the filter options when opened can be found in App.js[line 14]
    (<div onClick={() => closeFilterHandler()}>)
-I have also moved all the contextProvider from app.js to index.js
